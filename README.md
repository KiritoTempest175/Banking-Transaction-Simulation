## Overview

This project simulates a banking environment where users can send money, view transaction history, manage account limits, and download transcripts — all while the system maintains **cryptographic integrity** of every transaction using Merkle Trees and hash chains. An admin panel provides full oversight with the ability to approve, reject, or modify transactions before they are finalized.

The system is designed as a university-level project that bridges **Information Security**, **Software Engineering**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms** by applying theoretical concepts to a practical, user-facing application.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

### 🌳 Merkle Tree (`markle_tree.py`)

The Merkle Tree is the core data structure used for **transaction integrity verification**. It is a binary tree where:

- **Leaf nodes** store SHA-256 hashes of individual transaction amounts
- **Internal nodes** store the hash of the concatenation of their two children
- The **Merkle Root** is a single hash that represents the integrity of all transactions

```
         [Root Hash]
        /            \
   [Hash(A+B)]    [Hash(C+D)]
   /       \       /       \
 [H(tx1)] [H(tx2)] [H(tx3)] [H(tx4)]
```

**Key Operations:**

| Method | Description | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| `makeTreeFromArray(arr)` | Build a complete binary tree from transaction strings | O(n) |
| `calculateMerkleRoot()` | Compute the root hash via recursive hashing | O(n) |
| `getMerkleRoot()` | Return the cached Merkle Root | O(1) |
| `verifyUtil(arr)` | Re-build a tree from new data and compare roots | O(n) |

### 🔗 Hash Chain (Blockchain-style Ledger)

Each finalized transaction stores:
- `previous_hash` — the hash of the preceding transaction
- `hash` — `SHA-256(transaction_data + previous_hash)`

This creates an **immutable chain** where altering any past transaction would invalidate all subsequent hashes.

### 🔐 SHA-256 Hashing

Used for:
1. **PIN storage** — User PINs are hashed before storage
2. **Integrity sealing** — Standard-mode transactions are sealed with a hash at creation
3. **Ledger chaining** — Each transaction hash depends on the previous transaction
4. **Merkle Tree nodes** — All tree nodes store SHA-256 digests

## Usage

### Transaction Modes

The system supports two transaction processing modes:

| Mode | Processing | Integrity Check | Admin Intervention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fast** | Auto-approved after 30 seconds | No integrity hash | No admin review needed |
| **Standard** | Requires manual admin approval | SHA-256 integrity seal | Admin can approve/reject/modify |

### Workflow

```
User sends money ──► Transaction enters Snapshot Queue (PENDING)
                              │
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    │                   │
               [Fast Mode]        [Standard Mode]
                    │                   │
           Auto-approved          Admin reviews
           after 30 sec          (approve/reject)
                    │                   │
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
                              │
                   Added to Transaction Ledger
                   (hash-chained + Merkle Tree)
```

## Security Model

### Authentication Flow

```
User enters Account ID + PIN
        │
        ▼
PIN is SHA-256 hashed
        │
        ▼
Hash compared against stored pin_hash
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   │         │
 Match    Mismatch
   │         │
 Login    Increment failed_attempts
   │         │
   │    ≥ 3 attempts? ──► Lock Account
   │
   ▼
Role check ──► Admin? → Admin Dashboard
             └► User?  → User Dashboard
```

### Transaction Integrity (Standard Mode)

1. **At creation**: `integrity_hash = SHA-256(transaction_amount)`
2. **At approval**: Admin's modified amount is re-hashed and compared
3. **Mismatch** → Transaction is automatically **rolled back** with a security alert

### Merkle Tree Verification

1. All finalized transaction amounts are collected
2. A Merkle Tree is constructed with SHA-256 hashes as leaves
3. The Merkle Root is computed and displayed to users
4. Any tampering with even a single transaction changes the root hash
